- Norbert Wiener and his quote about computers as new slave labour.
- We automate jobs away -- are we responsible for the resulting degradation of
  life of those workers.
- Joseph Weizenbaum, Elisa. His quote about computer as "fundamentally
  conservative force".
- Technological progress sometimes enables continuing existing practice where
  otherwise social progress would be necessary.
- Ole-Johan Dahl, Simula, work with Norvegian worker unions. Build stuff that
  allows people to influence their fate and stuff.
- **Do we build technical stuff that works against our politics? If so, why do
  we do that?**
- Andrey Ershov - education, computer literacy, make at art of computer
  programming public property!

## Follow up

## General strategy

- Issues that we want to address:
  - How technology shapes society.
  - Users trust that technology works right.
  - Business models around software are not always ethical.
  - We don't always know where we are standing it terms of societal change.
    - "Facebook is practically dead"
  - Privacy, data collection, etc.
- Concrete avenues:
  - How do we raise awareness among software developers?
    - e.g. set the right defaults: e.g. https vs http,
  - How do we motivate developers to care.
  - How do we raise awareness among users of software?
  - How do we improve public understanding of technology?
  - How do we help policy makers that have good intentions to make
    technologically aware decisions.

### Next steps

1. Raising awareness among devs
  - Research on what already exists, existing organisations that work on this
    or close to it
  - List of resources, organisations that can provide information,
  - Create a website (or work with other orgs to create it)
  - Cooperate with existing organisations that are already doing it:
    - CCC
    - EFF
    - FSF
    - Fight for the Future
    - Effective Altruism
2. Motivation and inspiration
  - Carrots:
    - Success stories of ethical choices
    - Show respected people who care about these issues
  - Sticks:
    - Show consequences of not thinking about ethics, unethical behaviour
3. Coordination
  - Involve more people
  - Show them easy actionable ways to contribute
4. Raise awareness of ethical issues related to technology among general public
  / improve public understanding of technology
  - Make a curriculum and make it available to people who would use it to
    educate others.
  - Website? but who will read it. How do we reach people?
    - Scary stories
    - Jokes, pictures, basically we need to engage their emotions, logic won't
      really work.
    - Short explanatory videos (but we'll need comms-savvy people to do it)
  - Give users better options and inform them about existing ones:
    - People like EFF are working on it, maybe more efficient to work with them
  - Education, especially children
5. Implementing specific solutions for concrete problems (e.g. privacy, free
   software)

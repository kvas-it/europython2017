# The different roads we take (Tracy Osborn)

- Talks (concrete, focused, conclusions) vs Keynotes (discuss a topic, start
  conversation).

## My rocky road to CS

- Liked computers but prefer doing visual stuff.
- Lots of HTML, we pages.
- Went to study CS, but it all sounded like Chinese.
- Java wasn't really for me...
- But the GUIs really made sense.
- Abstract concepts didn't make sense at all despite all effort.
- The professor said that I was lazy and I left CS and did an Arts degree.
- I became a Frontend developer but avoided JavaScript since it's scary.

## In the bigger picture

- Women amond CS graduates:
  - 1985 37%
  - now 17%
- Percentage of women in CS-related professions also declined.
- The introductory book was renamed from Intro to Symbolic Programming to The
  Beauty and Joy of Computing, same year women in class outnumbered men.
  - The new coursebook sounds much more wide.
- Tried to found a startup (WeddingType) but didn't find a technical
  co-founder.
- Django is awesome, it hides all the complicated details.
  - Made the weddingtype app in 6 weeks.
  - Wrote Hello Web App book to help people build web apps.
    - Tailored to visual learning style.
  - Taught workshops.
  - Awesome.
- Recurse center: was hard to program something without Django, but not too
  bad.
- "One true programmer myth".

- We should be more acceptable of people who took a different path from us, or
  a non-traditional path.
- We should celebrate the different ways that people use to learn programming.
- Ultimately, everyone is self-taught, it's just that some people also have a
  CS degree.

- Simple frameworks and bootcamps increase the pool of people who can get into
  the field. It gets more diverse and that makes our community stronger.
- Not all beginners want the same thing (e.g. depth vs breadth).

## Action points

- Reject "one true programmer".
- Embrace the mediocre programmer (Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Python 2015).
- Don't classify things into beginner / intermediate / advanced.
  - Beginnner + Deployment,
  - Intermediate + Data Science.
- Mentor!
- Assess "what am I good at / what am I bad at".
- Build more tutorials, guides.
- You can teach even if you feel as a "beginner".
  - Experts sometimes make bad teachers because they forget how it felt to not
    understand these things.

# How to make inspiring data visualisations (Jan Willem Tulp)

- http://tulpinteractive.com

## General

- Apartment or Car market websites:
  - It's easy to find something exact, but
  - If you don't know what you want, it's a bad UI.
- How do we get the overview of a data set?
- Date -> Concept -> Visual design + Presentation
- Use some of the properties of the data to help the visualisation:
  - E.g. Iraq death toll bloody barchart

- What do people like interesting?
  - Different between people
  - Changes with time

- Visualisation magic quadrant
  - Common vs new/novel
  - Comprehensible vs incomprehensible

- Martini glass model
  - Start simple and focused, then open up

- Trigger -> Action -> Variable reward -> Effort -> Trigger
  - Something initially attractive,
  - Ability to interact and discover by yourself, but with a bit of work

- Tools:
  - Data preparation with Python
  - For the visuals: frameworks like D3

## Dutch Archive of Architecture and Urban Planning

- What does the archive look like?
- Visualisation design = Finding a visual representation of a data set that
  works for a particular situation.
- Visualising the data early helps to understand how does the data look like
  and what is its structure. It also shows what works and what looks nice.

## Hipparcos and the star catalog

## Tree density visualisation for Nature

- Finding the right metaphor so that visualisation looks like forests.

## Dutch voting of 2012

- Which cities vote in a similar way?
- What can we see from this visualisation?

# Tools

# Making Games with Python. Mission Impossible?

- Roberto De Ioris,
- Tomislav Uzelac,
- Martin Christen.

- Is it possible to make a game completely in Python?
  - Roberto: indy game, yes, AAA -- probably no,
  - Tomislav: at some point you'll always have C/C++ but writing logic in
    Python is totally possible, look at Eve Online.
  - Martin: yes, if you give me 10M, but in the real world, it's not clear what
    the reason would be. However, it's possible in many circumstances.

- Why use Python?
  - Roberto: Python is used for scripting in the videogame industry. Maya, 3DS
    Max, Blender all use it.

- Geo-information libraries in games?
  - Martin: for data processing Python is quite good. But when it gets to the
    actual game, that's a different story.

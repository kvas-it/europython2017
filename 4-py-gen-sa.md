# Python simulated annealing (poster session)

- https://github.com/sgubianpm/HyGSA
- NN + SA: https://gist.github.com/wingedsheep/af2c630bc6fcdcfbef8450ff9689d45f

## Ideas

- Can we do SA in parallel, sharing the emin and xmin between threads?
- Can we compile the function using TensorFlow or Theano and then use those
  frameworks, perhaps running the algo in parallel on a GPU?

# Overcoming cognitive biases (Anna Ravenscroft)

- Our brains are lazy. They use tricks, heuristics, shortcuts, etc. Sometimes
  it's awesome, at other times it leads to reasoning errors.
- Lots of examples about stereotyping women and minorities in programmer
  community, musicians, during hiring, during tech conferences.

- Actively counteract the biases when you're meeting people, when you're
  hiring, etc.

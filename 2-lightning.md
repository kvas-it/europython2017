# hello, I found a security issue

- As a developer
  - Clearly outline how people can report them,
  - Take reports seriously,
  - Fix it before it's used for bad things,
  - Clearly document fixed security issues.
  - If you have an issue, don't hide it!
- As a user / researcher
  - Check if the issue is known,
  - Inform the developer in private,
  - Allow a reasonable time for the issue to be fixed,
  - Keep track of the issue unless it's fixed (or the time expired).

# Being there vs documenting

- Diary to record what I feel / think is better than a camera,
- Experience first of all, then maybe record.

# Tips on acing tech interviews

- Questions about experience
  - Prove that you might be able to work on the project that you're working on,
  - I want to understand the project.
- Positive attitude,
- Evidence that you can solve problems and think about edge cases.
- Ask in advance how you will be tested (as an interviewer: tell candidates).
- Communication: friendly (also under stress), able to communicate technical
  concepts.

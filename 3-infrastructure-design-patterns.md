# Infrastructure design patterns (David Lue)

- There are many tools:
  - Cheff, puppet,
  - Dask,
  - Celery, Kafka,
- Sometimes the tools are used not for their intended purpose.
- Buildbot is made for CI but it (and some of its pieces) are quite generic,
- We can have it drive virtual boxes, etc,

## Notes

- BuildBotTravis seems to be alive again:

# How to use Graphql with Django

Patric Arminio

- REST APIs are nice but not ideal for all purposes:
  - Too many calls,
  - Or you can create additional endpoints, but then it's too many endpoints
    and sometimes too much data transfer.
- GraphQL to the rescue!
  - It allows expressing exactly what you want
  - pip install graphene
  - pip install graphene-django

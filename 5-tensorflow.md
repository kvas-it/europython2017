# Introduction to TensorFlow (Alejandro Solano)

- How do we learn to identify cat pictures: Deep learning.
- How do we do deep learning in Python: TensorFlow is the bestest.

## Concepts

- Computation graph that's defined explicitly. Then we can run it using a
  session and get output.
- We can define the cost function and feed the whole shebang to an optimiser
  to adjust the parameters of the model.

## Q/A

- Why choose TF (and not Theano, for example)? Because it's cool and it's from
  Google :P
